I'm an upcoming sophomore at [UBC](https://ubc.ca) ‚ö° in Vancouver, BC ‚òî. I'm currently pursuing on Honors Computer Science degree in the Faculty of Science.

This summer, I'm interning with my school's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering to help transition various software-based courses online, and migrating our old website, [ece.ubc.ca](https://ece.ubc.ca), from Drupal to WordPress. I'm also completing contract work with a Calgary-based software start-up known as [Artesian Software](https://artesiansoft.com/), where I mostly do fullstack web development. You can see the project I'm working on [here](https://shieldscore.com).

In the past, I've worked as a TA for courses based in Python and Racket, built a volunteer tracker web-app for a Vancouver nonprofit, and made a VS Code extension to help beginners practice coding problems daily. You can learn more about what I've been up to in the past on my website, [here](https://michaeldemar.co).

I'm currently looking for internships for Winter (Jan-Apr) ‚ùÑ  and Summer (May-Aug) ‚òÄ 2021. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelfromyeg/) or via e-mail.

I also own a pet tortoise. Say hi to [Leo](https://www.instagram.com/leoeatinglettuce/).
